"# Sideswipe Study with Bikelane

This project analyzes the effect of adding bike lanes on sideswipe crash occurrences at intersections. The goal is to evaluate whether the presence of bike lanes reduces conflicts and improves safety for bicyclists, especially at signalized intersections or areas with high crash frequency.

## 🚦 Project Objectives

- Identify and extract intersections from OpenStreetMap for a study area (e.g., Tampa)
- Collect and preprocess crash data with a focus on sideswipe crashes
- Integrate aerial imagery and roadway design data where available
- Compare crash patterns before and after bike lane implementation
- Generate summary statistics, visualizations, and geospatial outputs
